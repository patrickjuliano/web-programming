        <main>
            <p>It was a cold winter night. Reluctantly, I checked Canvas. An assignment: Lab 7. I knew what had to be done.</p>
            <p>My fingers sped across the keyboard. Each stroke was made with precision and care. Before long, I'd completed and submitted it.</p>
            <p>To no one's surprise, I scored a 100%. A perfect score! The TA even decided to tack on an extra 10% for my hard work and dedication.</p>
